What better way to start a new blog then those famous first words. Well famous in computer science/IT/programming. If this doesn't sound familiar to you I'll give you a minute to check the following reference: ["Hello, world!" on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program). Go ahead, I'll wait.

Done?

Ok, now that we have that straight, I'll say that I'm hoping to be able to put up new content about once a week. In a good week it might be twice. 

That is all. Feel free to check out my [twitter](https://twitter.com/paulvaillant) or [github](https://github.com/pvaillant) accounts for anything you might find interesting in a mean time.
