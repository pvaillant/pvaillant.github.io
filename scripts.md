## Misc Scripts

These are the various scripts that I write and talk about on my blog. They're here instead of in separate repositories because they are more one-off scripts but since my blog is on [GitHub](https://github.com/pvaillant/pvaillant.github.io), if you have ideas (feature improvements, optimizations, etc) or see a bug, feel free to [open a ticket](https://github.com/pvaillant/pvaillant.github.io/issues/new) and I'd be happy to take a look.

<ul class="scripts">
	<li>[Get-LyncConferenceAdoption.ps1](/content/Get-LyncConferenceAdoption.ps1) (see [Measuring Lync Conference Adoption]({% post_url 2015-03-03-measuring-lync-conference-adoption %}))</li>
	<li>[Get-LyncLogins.ps1](/content/Get-LyncLogins.ps1) (see [Last Login for a SIP URI]({% post_url 2015-02-22-last-login-for-a-sip-uri %}))</li>
</ul>
