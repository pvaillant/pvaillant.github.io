## Misc Scripts

These are the various scripts that I write and talk about on my blog. They're here instead of in separate repositories because they are more one-off scripts but since my blog is on [GitHub](https://github.com/pvaillant/pvaillant.github.io), if you have ideas (feature improvements, optimizations, etc) or see a bug, feel free to [open a ticket](https://github.com/pvaillant/pvaillant.github.io/issues/new) and I'd be happy to take a look.
